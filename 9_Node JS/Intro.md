# Node.js Introduction

## Overview
Node.js is a runtime environment that allows JavaScript to run outside the browser. It is mainly used for building fast, scalable, and efficient server-side applications.

It is built on Google’s V8 JavaScript engine and follows an asynchronous, event-driven architecture.

## Features of Node.js
- **Server-Side JavaScript** – Runs JavaScript for backend development  
- **Asynchronous & Non-Blocking** – Efficiently handles multiple requests  
- **Single-Threaded Event Loop** – Manages concurrent operations  
- **V8 Engine** – High-performance JavaScript execution  
- **Scalable & Lightweight** – Ideal for microservices and high-traffic apps  
- **Rich NPM Ecosystem** – Access to thousands of open-source packages

## Hello World Program
A simple program to demonstrate JavaScript execution outside the browser.

```js
console.log("Hello, World!");


## Node.js Architecture Components

V8 Engine – Compiles JavaScript into machine code

Event Loop – Handles asynchronous operations

Libuv – Manages I/O operations and thread pool

Non-Blocking I/O – Executes tasks without waiting
